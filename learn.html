                <h2>The Power of Compounding: Your Wealth Accelerator</h2>
                <p class="meta">Published: November 16, 2025</p>
                
                <p>Compounding, often called the eighth wonder of the world, is the process where the returns you earn on your investment are reinvested to generate their own returns. Essentially, you earn returns on your initial principal AND on your accumulated returns.</p>

                <h3>How Does it Work?</h3>
                <p>Imagine you invest ₹1,00,000 at 10% annual interest. In year one, you earn ₹10,000, making your total ₹1,10,000. In year two, you earn 10% not just on the original ₹1,00,000, but on the full ₹1,10,000, earning you ₹11,000. This cycle accelerates over time, which is why starting early is crucial for long-term wealth creation.</p>
                
                <h3>Key Takeaways for Investors</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>**Start Early:** Time is your biggest asset in compounding.</li>
                    <li>**Be Consistent:** Regular investments (like SIPs) allow you to take advantage of market cycles.</li>
                    <li>**Be Patient:** The real magic happens in the later years of your investment journey.</li>
                </ul>
